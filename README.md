# Python Resources
Below is also a list of a few resources I've used in the past for Python, along with demos I've created over the years.

## Online Demos
- Pandas Demo: https://bitly.com/MqPandas
- Web Scraping: https://bit.ly/MqWeb
- NLP Demo: https://bitly.com/MqNLP
- Image processing (OCR): http://bit.ly/MqOCR
- Yahoo Finance Demo: https://marqueegroup.ca/resource/how-to-use-python-in-a-finance-environment/

## Popular Python Packages
A couple articles I wrote on top 25 packages I use on day to day basis in Python:
https://marqueegroup.ca/resource/python-packages-101-part-1/
https://marqueegroup.ca/resource/python-packages-101-part-2/

This link also has a great list of all the popular "finance" packages in Python:

## My Medium Account:
https://bogdan-tudose.medium.com/
- I wrote several articles on Python Packages, using Streamlit to create interactive dashboards, and using the Yahoo Finance API to scrape live market data
- you can also find my lists of bookmarked articles on there (I've tried to categorize them by topic)
- the codes behind the Python dashboards I created can also be found on my github: https://github.com/dbogt

## Extra resources
- https://medium.com/ - this is one of the main websites I use nowadays for quick tutorials, there are various articles on here related to Python, search for example Pandas with Python, or Web Scraping with Python, Beautiful Soup with Python, etc.
- http://towardsdatascience.com/ - a lot of their articles are also on Medium
- http://www.reddit.com/r/Python 
- https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython
- https://stackoverflow.com/ - people usually ask specific questions and best answer gets upvoted
- https://pbpython.com/ - newsletter/blog with some practical business applications

## Alternative Data Sets
The best way to practice with Pandas is to import and manipulate different data sets. Ideally, try using excel/csv files that you already have at work and use on a day to day basis. However, if you want to experiment with "cleaner" data sets (that don't have as many issues) there are a couple websites I use below.

- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/ 
  - they have thousands of different public data sets that you can download and play around with; a lot of data sets are uploaded by users of kaggle
  - they also have lots of free tutorials with Python on how manipulate their data sets, use machine learning on them, etc.

- Google Data Sets: https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/
- Canadian Government data sets: https://open.canada.ca/en/open-data
- US Government data sets: https://www.data.gov/
- IMF data sets: http://data.imf.org/
- FiveThirtyEight (Nate Silver) data sets: https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/
- NASDAQ data sets: https://data.nasdaq.com/search
